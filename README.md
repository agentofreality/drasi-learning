# Learning about Drasi
This repo contains code for sample applications that use Drasi as an end-to-end solution for change detection and real-time reactions. The applications will help you understand how to implement and deploy Drasi for different scenarios. Each app folder  within this repo has a README.md which details what the scenario for the app, code for the apps, requisite test data, and how to run the samples.

## Sample Applications
This repo has the following applications in folders:
1. [Building comfort](apps/building-comfort)- Drasi for a building management scenario
2. [Curbside pickup](apps/curbside-pickup)- Drasi for a notification service to alert drivers when orders are ready for pickup
3. [Fleet POC](https://github.com/drasi-project/learning/tree/main/apps/fleet-poc)- Drasi for an efficient solution to translate vehicle telemetery into actionable insights for Connected Fleet scenarios
4. [Kubernetes Demo](https://github.com/drasi-project/learning/tree/main/apps/k8s)- Drasi used to assess the images of Kubernetes cluster and detect risks.
5. [Non-events](https://github.com/drasi-project/learning/tree/main/apps/non-events) - An app to demonstrate Drasi's abilities to trigger alerts when events do not occur within a stipulated time window.
